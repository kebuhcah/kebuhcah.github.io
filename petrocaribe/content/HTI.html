<p><b>Haiti</b>'s Petrocaribe membership was initially considered to be political showmanship for then-Haitian president, Rene Preval's inauguration day, and it was believed that Haiti might not actually implement the agreement.</p><p>The first Petrocaribe shipment to Haiti stayed in storage for two months because no distribution plans had been developed and the Haitian government was concerned about handing over distribution to their alliance partner considering the "inconsistent and unreliable history of Petrocaribe in other Caribbean nations."</p>
<p>Despite these early hiccups, and serious disputes with international oil companies over the division of responsibility for importing and transporting oil, Haiti's total oil consumption is now 100% covered by Petrocaribe.</p>
