  <p><b>St. Vincent and the Grenadines</b>'s president Ralph Gonsalves, who has led the island nation since 2001, was widely considered one of Hugo Chavez' greatest admirers among Anglo-Caribbean heads of state, according to Wikileaks cables.</p>
  <p>The first Petrocaribe shipment to St. Vincent and the Grenadines arrived in the midst of a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) pricing dispute between Gonsalves' government and Texaco.</p>
  <p>A Venezuelan LPG shipment, believed to be a political favor for Gonsalves, came in the form of a shipping container full of small LPG cylinders that had to be unloaded by hand, which was extremely inefficient compared to delivery by tanker.</p>
<p>Private sector representatives in St. Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern over investment flight and a threat to tourism due to government ties with Venezuela, according to a Wikileaks cable.</p>
