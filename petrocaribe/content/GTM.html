  <p>According to Wikileaks, <b>Guatemala</b>'s government became interested in Petrocaribe during a surge in oil prices in 2008.</p>
  <p>Throughout the negotiation process, a key conflict between Guatemala and Venezuela was that Venezuela appeared to emphasize symbolism over substance. While the Guatemalan government wanted to ensure that all arrangements and terms were in order before signing any agreement, Venezuela hoped that Guatemala would sign first and ask questions later - an approach that seems typical of Petrocaribe's dealings with most other countries.</p>
