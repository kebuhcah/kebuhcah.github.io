  <p><b>Antigua and Barbuda</b>’s entrance into Petrocaribe allowed for the use of the existing privately-owned West Indies Oil Company’s storage facilities. This was a departure from Chavez’s original plans of only dealing with state-owned entities.</p>
  <p>Chavez' socialist ideals did not take into account the reality that it is not economically viable for these small island states to have state-run oil companies and in this case especially, to duplicate a working private infrastructure.</p>
  <p>With only three members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States already in Petrocaribe before Antigua joined, Venezuela was getting slack for delivering little to no oil in the area after making big promises so deciding to work with a private company was necessary.</p>
  <p>Antigua and Barbuda has a positive relationship with Venezuela and the Petrocaribe alliance, however Wikileaks cables suggest that Antigua and Barbuda, as well as other Eastern Caribbean countries "are simply milking what they can from a willing cash cow [Venezuela]."</p>
