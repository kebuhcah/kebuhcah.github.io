  <p>Despite only officially joining Petrocaribe in 2014, <b>El Salvador</b> has been a recipient of Petrocaribe oil via Nicaragua since as early as 2008, per Wikileaks.</p>
  <p>A group of six mayors from the leftist Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion (FMLN) began a "pilot plan" in December 2008 to distribute discounted Venezuelan diesel through six independent "white flag" service stations.</p>
  <p>In a period of only three weeks, imports were up by more than 300,000 gallons. However, while distributing fuel, at least one of these service centers was photographed displaying a Venezuelan flag. </p>

<p>While some politicians originally suggested that the excess money made by selling at below market prices would be used for social projects, FLMN's presidential candidate told embassy officials that it would in fact be used to fund FMLN election campaigns.</p>
<p>Despite complaints from international oil companies that this "dumping" distorted the market, the Salvadorian government was politically constrained as it did not want to appear to be against low oil prices.</p>
