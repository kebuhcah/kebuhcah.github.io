  <p><b>Belize</b> received its first shipment of Petrocaribe oil from Venezuela in early November, 2005, with no prior notice. </p>
  <p>This was apparently meant as a "good-will gesture." However, since no prior arrangements had been made with ESSO or any local petroleum distributors, the shipment was held up for four days before it could be offloaded. The shipment was subsequently purchased at a significant discount.</p>
  <p>As a consequence of ESSO's reluctance to receive any further shipments of Petro-Caribe oil, the Belizian Government was forced to seek out other alternatives to get Petrocaribe going in Belize.</p>
</div>
<p>From 2009 to 2012, the Petrocaribe program in Belize was suspended due to disagreements between the Belizean and Venezuelan goverments concerning costs, as well as the Venezuelan government's desire for more control.</p>
<p>Venezuela had unilaterally decided to replace all existing supply arrangements with joint ventures in which PDVSA would have a controlling stake. Planned meetings to set up this new arrangement were repeatedly delayed and the program was not renewed until 2012.</p>
