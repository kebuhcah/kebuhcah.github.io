    <p>President of the <b>Dominican Republic</b> Leonel Fernandez was worried about being "any other country’s puppet" when considering whether or not to join Petrocaribe.</p>
    <p>Venezuela tried to convince Fernandez to create a joint government venture between the two countries but Dominican Minister of Industry and Commerce, Francisco Javier Garcia, believed that this idea actually stemmed from Cuba's president, Fidel Castro.</p>
    <p>Either way, Javier Garcia does not want to be involved with ‘the ideology or geostrategic aims of Hugo Chavez or Fidel Castro.”</p>
    <p>The agreement to join Petrocaribe moved forward partly because it the Dominican government had announced it would most likely be restricting how often people could use their cars in an effort to save energy and this agreement could provide an "escape from adverse public reaction" about this situation.</p>
