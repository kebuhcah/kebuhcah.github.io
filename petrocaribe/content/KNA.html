  <p><b>Saint Kitts and Nevis</b> signed the Petrocaribe agreement in 2005, but soon discovered that the country did not have a port large enough to accept Venezuelan tankers. This delayed the implementation of Petrocaribe for several years.</p>
  <p>The agreement between Saint Kitts and Nevis and Venezuela was pushed mainly by one person - Oaklyn Peets, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Public Works.</p>
  <p>Wikileaks cables show that Saint Kitts and Nevis' interest in the partnership was purely monetary and they had no intention of furthering their relations with Venezuela by joining ALBA or signing the Energy Security Treaty.</p>
