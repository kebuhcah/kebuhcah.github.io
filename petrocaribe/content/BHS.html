  <p><b>Bahamas</b> signed up for Petrocaribe in 2005, but has never set a Petrocaribe supply quota or received any Petrocaribe shipments.</p>
  <p>On Nov. 30, 2008 the Bahamian Prime Minister at the time, Hubert Ingraham, said that joining Petrocaribe was a "stupid proposal" at a meet-the-press event.</p>
  <p>Not only is Petrocaribe incompatible with the Bahamasâ€™ completely privatized oil distribution system, but both the conservative and liberal parties expressed reservations about being indebted to Venezuela.</p>
