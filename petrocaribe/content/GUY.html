<p>Although <b>Guyana</b> has oscillated over the last three decades between importing oil from Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela, since 2002 it had primarily been dealing with the former.</p>
<p>However, with a sharp increase in oil prices over recent years, the Guyanese government decided that the deal with Petrocaribe was "too good to pass up."</p>
