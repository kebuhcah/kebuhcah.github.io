<p>Though <b>Suriname</b> was among the first batch of countries to sign up for Petrocaribe in 2005, Petrocaribe shipments did not actually commence until after the 2010 election of Desi Bouterse, a convicted drug trafficker and alleged mass-murderer.</p>
<p>The Bouterse family has close ties to the Venezuelan government and received political support from Venezuela while in opposition. Bouterse's son Dino, who travelled to Venezuela frequently and supported Nicolas Maduro's reelection campaign, was convicted in a New York court in 2015 on drug and terrorism charges.</p>

<p>The chief Surinamese negotiator for Petrocaribe, Etienne Boerenveen, was arrested by the DEA in Miami in the late 80s on drug charges, and later released early for good behavior, having served less than half his sentence. Dutch sources believe that Suriname was able to secure Boerenveen's release by agreeing to not import drugs into the U.S., and only to Europe.</p>
<p>Suriname's arrangement with Venezuela is unique within Petrocaribe in that Suriname accrues no debt to Venezuela - instead, all savings go into an investment fund for a variety of social projects in Suriname. Suriname's status as a minor (but growing) oil producer in its own right gives it some leverage in this relationship.</p>
<p>In a Wikileaks cable, U.S. Ambassador to Suriname Lisa Schreiber Hughes expressed her sentiment that the Petrocaribe deal "looked good on paper" and would mainly be seen as something positive in the eyes of the average Surinamese.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Petrocaribe has not always run smoothly in Suriname. <a href="http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/18587">A delayed Petrocaribe shipment in August 2013</a> threw the country into chaos as citizens were unable to fuel their vehicles over the Indigenous Peoples' Day weekend, a major holiday in the country. An emergency shipment from Trinidad and Tobago was needed to tide the country over.</p>
