  <p>As <b>Venezuela</b>’s political system continues to unravel, in large part due to falling oil prices, there have been shortages of basic goods. Coupled with a deadlocked legislature controlled by the opposition, the country’s productivity and entire economy are threatened.</p>
  <p>Seams are beginning to appear in Venezuela’s decade-old Petrocaribe system, revealing neglect by both Venezuela and foreign governments and corporations.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Venezuela’s political climate has become bleaker with time, spurred in large part by a struggling economy. In January of this year, President Nicolas Maduro declared a state of “economic emergency.”</p>
  <p>The tolls have been high. Blackouts have rolled through Venezuela, and the government has mandated a two-day work week for public employees based on a need to conserve energy.</p>

<p>Protests first broke out in February 2014, and within that first month multiple protesters were killed due to disproportionate reactions from the Venezuelan military. By early 2015, 43 people had been killed in various skirmishes between protesters, pro-government groups and military.</p>
<p>Security forces, according to Human Rights Watch, also targeted journalists who were trying to document the protesters. They sought out reporters who were filming the events, and reprimanded them for shooting video.</p>
<p>Many Venezuelans also believe their government to be corrupt. According to Gallup in 2014, more than half of the country considered the political scene to be unstable leading up to the protests, and the perception of corruption in the national government jumped from the mid-60s to 75 percent in 2013.</p>
